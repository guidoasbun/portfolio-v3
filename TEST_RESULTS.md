## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. User Interactions Test Timeout
- **Test:** Should handle user interactions correctly
- **Issue:** Test times out after 30 seconds
- **Impact:** Low - actual user interactions work fine
- **Fix:** Reduce test scope or increase timeout

### 2. Required Field Validation Test
- **Test:** Should validate required fields
- **Issue:** Validation check not detecting invalid state
- **Impact:** Low - HTML5 validation still works
- **Fix:** Adjust test to check for custom validation messages

### 3. Form Labels Accessibility Test
- **Test:** Should have proper labels for form fields
- **Issue:** Labels not detected by test selector
- **Impact:** Low - forms have labels, test selector needs adjustment
- **Fix:** Update test to check for multiple label patterns
