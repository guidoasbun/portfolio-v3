- [ ] Set up .firebaserc with project ID
- [ ] Configure Cloud Functions (Gen 2) for API routes/SSR
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD (firebase init hosting:github)
- [ ] Configure environment variables in Firebase Console
- [ ] Set up custom domain in Firebase Hosting
- [ ] Configure SSL certificate (automatic with Firebase)
- [ ] Create production build (npm run build)
- [ ] Test production build locally (firebase emulators:start)

- [ ] Verify all features work in production
- [ ] Test API routes and Cloud Functions
- [ ] Verify Firebase Authentication works
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Set up Firebase monitoring and alerts

## Testing Checkpoints

### After Each Phase:

- [ ] Run build command to check for errors
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Validate TypeScript types
- [ ] Review accessibility
- [ ] Test in different browsers

## Performance Targets

- **Lighthouse Score**: 90+ for all metrics
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3.5s
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB initial
- **3D Scene FPS**: 60fps on desktop, 30fps on mobile

## Fallback Strategies

### For 3D Components:

- Static images for low-power devices
- CSS animations as fallback
- Reduced particle count on mobile
- 2D canvas alternative
- Progressive enhancement approach

### For Advanced Features:

- Basic HTML forms if JavaScript fails
- Static content if database unavailable
- Local storage for offline support
- Image placeholders during loading
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Dependencies Between Phases

- Phase 2 requires Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 can start after Phase 2 UI components
- Phase 4 (Three.js) can run parallel to Phase 3
- Phase 5 (Firebase) can start anytime after Phase 1
- Phase 6 requires Phase 5 completion
- Phase 7 requires Phases 3, 5, and 6
- Phase 8 requires all previous phases

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Three.js Performance**: Start with simple 3D, profile continuously
2. **Firebase Costs**: Implement rate limiting early
3. **Bundle Size**: Monitor with bundle analyzer
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Test early and often
5. **Mobile Performance**: Develop mobile-first for 3D

## Success Metrics

- Portfolio loads in under 3 seconds
- All features work on mobile
- Admin dashboard is intuitive
- 3D elements enhance, not distract
- Contact form receives messages
- Projects showcase effectively
- Site is discoverable via search

This roadmap provides approximately 200 small, actionable tasks that can be tracked and completed incrementally. Adjust timeline based on your availability and complexity of implementation.
